# setup k3s with aws ecr integration on Fedora server
# updated June 2025
# tested on Fedora 42 Server Edition
# ! NOTE - this expects that fedora-server-initial-setup.yml has been ran as a prereq

# to run 
# ansible-playbook -i your_server_ip, -u andrew --ask-become-pass fedora-k3s-with-aws-ecr.yml

# - after running perform the following manual steps 
# 1. configure the aws cli with a key for a IAM role that has read access to AWS ECR
#   aws configure
# 2. do a test run of the cron script 
#   sh /root/cron/ecr_secret_cron.sh &>> /var/log/ecr_login_log.txt

# this repo is a example of how to use the ecr integration
# https://github.com/openmarmot/simple-ecr-container-flask-rest/tree/main
